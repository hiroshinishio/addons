## Before we promote:

## After we're done:
- Deploy `customs` `4.12.0` (see also https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/SVCSE-1578)
- Run `./manage.py update_and_clean_categories` in a `screen` or equivalent to unify categories and delete obsolete ones (can take 5 to 15 minutes, it does it in batches of 1000 to avoid overloading the database)
