# AMO Release Monday 23rd October 2023

This week's push hero is [mat](https://github.com/diox)

## Notable things shipping:
- This is a planned off-schedule push to prevent extensions we made compatible with Firefox for Android 119 Beta for testing purposes from showing up in Firefox for Android 119 release, which is planned for October 24th. It is a cherry-pick on top of the 2023.10.12 addons-server tag with only a couple changes related to a single issue:
  - https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/21293
- ~~We may also use this occasion to add more add-ons to the testing list for Beta/Nightly users, if provided~~
