## Before we start:

## Before we promote:

## After we're done:
- Two django commands need to be run, and the second shouldn't be run until the first is done. We can check that the first is done by looking at the messages in the log. The two commands are:
1. `./manage.py extract_host_permissions`
2. `./manage.py reindex`

mat can help monitor the logs, to determine when the second command can be run.

- Enable the strictest de-sync mitigation mode for all AMO ELBs
