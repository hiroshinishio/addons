## Before we start:

## Before we promote:

## After we're done:
- Deploy `customs` `4.0.0` to production together with updated settings causing the lambda to run with Node 16
- Run `./manage.py process_translations --task=update_outgoing_url` to update existing database translations to use the new outgoing URL (this should take about a minute to run and then spawn multiple celery tasks that will take care of the job)
- Run `./manage.py migrate_user_photos` to migrate user photos to the newer deeper directory structure on EFS (this should take a while and run synchronously, use a `screen` or equivalent)
