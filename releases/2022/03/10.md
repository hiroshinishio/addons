## Before we promote:

## After we're done:
- run `./manage.py cron write_sitemaps` in a `screen` (it's typically run as a cronjob once a day but we want to re-run it as soon as deployment is done to ensure the files it generates are present. It should take ~45 minutes - took 22 minutes on stage)
- Remove `/mnt/efs/addons.mozilla.org/cache directory per https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/SVCSE-407?focusedCommentId=521310
- Deploy https://github.com/mozilla-services/cloudops-deployment/pull/4546 which has been on the -dev and -stage for 2 weeks.
